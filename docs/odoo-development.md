# ðŸ§© Odoo Development Guide

This page provides the **standard development workflow and best practices** for all Odoo projects within our team.  
It is designed to help both new and existing developers maintain a clean, consistent, and collaborative codebase.

## Commit Message Structure

To maintain a clean and traceable Git history, all commits must follow the **standardized commit message format**.  
This ensures that every change is clearly described and can be linked to its related task or issue.

### Structure

| | **MIG** â†’ Migration related changes (e.g., DB schema) | |
